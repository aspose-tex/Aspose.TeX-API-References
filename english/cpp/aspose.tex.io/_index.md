The **[Aspose.TeX.IO](./)** namespace provides classes for I/O that [TeX](../aspose.tex/) engine performs.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IFileCollector](./ifilecollector/) | Defines methods for selecting collections of files. |
| [IInputTerminal](./iinputterminal/) | Interface for abstract input terminal. |
| [IInputWorkingDirectory](./iinputworkingdirectory/) | Interface of generalized input working directory. |
| [InputConsoleTerminal](./inputconsoleterminal/) | Provides the console as a terminal input source. |
| [InputFileSystemDirectory](./inputfilesystemdirectory/) | Implements the regular file system's method for getting a file stream to read from. |
| [InputZipDirectory](./inputzipdirectory/) | Implements the method for getting a file stream to write to when working directory is a ZIP archive. |
| [IOutputTerminal](./ioutputterminal/) | Interface for abstract output terminal. |
| [IOutputWorkingDirectory](./ioutputworkingdirectory/) | Interface of generalized output working directory. |
| [NamedStream](./namedstream/) | Associates a stream of a random nature with a name. |
| [NondisposableMemoryStream](./nondisposablememorystream/) | The class that encapsulates a stream that cannot be disposed by calling the [System::IDisposable::Dispose](../system/idisposable/dispose/) method, whether explicitly or implicitly. |
| [OutputConsoleTerminal](./outputconsoleterminal/) | Provides the console as a terminal output destination. |
| [OutputFileSystemDirectory](./outputfilesystemdirectory/) | Implements the regular file system's method for getting a file stream to write to. |
| [OutputFileTerminal](./outputfileterminal/) | Implements a terminal whose output is to be written to a file in some working directory. |
| [OutputMemoryTerminal](./outputmemoryterminal/) | Provides a memory stream as a terminal output destination. |
| [OutputZipDirectory](./outputzipdirectory/) | Implements the method for getting a file stream to write to when working directory is a ZIP archive. |
