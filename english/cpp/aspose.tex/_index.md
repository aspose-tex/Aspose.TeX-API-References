The **[Aspose.TeX](./)** is a root namespace for all classes of the [Aspose.TeX](./) library which are either directly contained within it, such as **[TeXJob](./texjob/)**, or indirectly through several nested namespaces.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AssemblyConstants](./assemblyconstants/) | Defines the constants that participate in the license check for the component. These used to be defined directly as assembly attributes, but I moved them into separate class because in .NET Compact Framework I cannot access assembly attributes. Now the licensing code when compiled for the .NET Compact Framework uses these constants instead of the assembly attributes. |
| [BuildVersionInfo](./buildversioninfo/) | This class provides information about current product build. |
| [License](./license/) | Provides methods to license the component. |
| [Metered](./metered/) | Provides methods to set metered key. |
| [TeXConfig](./texconfig/) | Class providing available [TeX](./) configurations. |
| [TeXExtension](./texextension/) | Class defining constants to choose a [TeX](./) engine extension from. |
| [TeXJob](./texjob/) | Implements features of a [TeX](./) job. |
| [TeXOptions](./texoptions/) | [TeX](./) file processing options class. |
## Enums

| Enum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EditionType](./editiontype/) | Specifies the edition type of the license. |
| [Interaction](./interaction/) | Represents increasing amounts of user interaction. |
| [LicenseState](./licensestate/) | Represents possible license states. |
| [ProductType](./producttype/) | Which product of the license or black list : **Aspose** or Conholdate. |
| [ShellMode](./shellmode/) | Enumerates values that determine the availability of \write18. |
| [TeXJobResult](./texjobresult/) | Lists possible results of a [TeX](./) job. |
