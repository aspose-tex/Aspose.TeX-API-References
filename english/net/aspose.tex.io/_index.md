| [InputZipDirectory](./inputzipdirectory/) | Implements the method for getting a file stream to write to when working directory is a ZIP archive. |
| [NamedStream](./namedstream/) | Associates a stream of a random nature with a name. |
| [NondisposableMemoryStream](./nondisposablememorystream/) | The class that encapsulates a stream that cannot be disposed by calling the Dispose method, whether explicitly or implicitly. |
| [OutputConsoleTerminal](./outputconsoleterminal/) | Provides the console as a terminal output destination. Wrapper for Out. |
| [OutputFileSystemDirectory](./outputfilesystemdirectory/) | Implements the regular file system's method for getting a file stream to write to. |
| [OutputFileTerminal](./outputfileterminal/) | Implements a terminal whose output is to be written to a file in some working directory. |
| [OutputMemoryTerminal](./outputmemoryterminal/) | Provides a memory stream as a terminal output destination. |
| [OutputZipDirectory](./outputzipdirectory/) | Implements the method for getting a file stream to write to when working directory is a ZIP archive. |
## Interfaces
