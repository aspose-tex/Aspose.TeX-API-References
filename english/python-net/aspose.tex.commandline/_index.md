| [`Executable`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.commandline/executable/) | The base class for classes that emulate the behavior of OS executables,<br/>            which can be run by the occurrences of Object TeX's `\write18` primitive. |
| [`ExecutablesList`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.commandline/executableslist/) | Encapsulates a collection of objects that emulate executables,<br/>            which can be executed using the `\write18` commands in ObjectTeX. |
