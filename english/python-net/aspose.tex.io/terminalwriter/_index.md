## TerminalWriter class

Provides writing to a text stream.



The TerminalWriter type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [encoding](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/encoding) | Returns the character encoding in which the output is written. |
| [new_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/new_line) | Gets or sets the line terminator string used by the current TextWriter. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#) | Writes a line terminator to the text stream. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#bool) | Writes the text representation of a Boolean value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#str) | Writes a string to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#char) | Writes a character to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#list) | Writes an array of characters to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#decimal) |  |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#float) | Writes the text representation of a 8-byte floating-point value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#float) | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte floating-point value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#int) | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte signed integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#int) | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte signed integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#int) | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte unsigned integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write_line](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write_line/#int) | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte unsigned integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#bool) | Writes the text representation of a Boolean value to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#char) | Writes a character to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#str) | Writes a string to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#list) | Writes a character array to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#decimal) |  |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#float) | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte floating-point value to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#float) | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte floating-point value to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#int) | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte signed integer to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#int) | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte signed integer to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#int) | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte unsigned integer to the text stream. |
| [write](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/write/#int) | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte unsigned integer to the text stream. |
| [flush](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/flush/#) | Clears all buffers for the current writer and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device. |
| [close](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter/close/#) | Closes the current writer and releases any system resources associated with the writer. |
