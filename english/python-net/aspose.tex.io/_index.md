The **Aspose.TeX.IO**  namespace provides classes for I/O that TeX engine performs.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`IFileCollector`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/ifilecollector) | Defines methods for selecting collections of files. |
| [`IFileTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/ifileterminal) | Interface of terminals which actually are files. |
| [`IInputTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/iinputterminal) | Interface for abstract input terminal. |
| [`IInputWorkingDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/iinputworkingdirectory) | Interface of generalized input working directory. |
| [`IOutputTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/ioutputterminal) | Interface for abstract output terminal. |
| [`IOutputWorkingDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/ioutputworkingdirectory) | Interface of generalized output working directory. |
| [`InputConsoleTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/inputconsoleterminal) | Provides the console as a terminal input source. Wrapper for In. |
| [`InputFileSystemDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/inputfilesystemdirectory) | Implements the regular file system's method for getting a file stream to read from. |
| [`InputWorkingDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/inputworkingdirectory) | The basic class for input working directories. |
| [`InputZipDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/inputzipdirectory) | Implements the method for getting a file stream to write to when working directory is a ZIP archive. |
| [`NamedStream`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/namedstream) | Combines a stream of a random nature with a name. |
| [`NondisposableMemoryStream`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/nondisposablememorystream) | The class that encapsulates a stream that cannot be disposed by calling<br/>the System.IDisposable.Dispose method, whether explicitly or implicitly. |
| [`OutputConsoleTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/outputconsoleterminal) | Provides the console as a terminal output destination. Wrapper for Out. |
| [`OutputFileSystemDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/outputfilesystemdirectory) | Implements the regular file system's method for getting a file stream to write to. |
| [`OutputFileTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/outputfileterminal) | Implements a terminal whose output is to be written to a file in some working directory. |
| [`OutputMemoryTerminal`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/outputmemoryterminal) | Provides a memory stream as a terminal output destination. |
| [`OutputZipDirectory`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/outputzipdirectory) | Implements the method for getting a file stream to write to when working directory is a ZIP archive. |
| [`TerminalReader`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalreader) | Provides reading from a text stream. |
| [`TerminalWriter`](/tex/python-net/aspose.tex.io/terminalwriter) | Provides writing to a text stream. |
