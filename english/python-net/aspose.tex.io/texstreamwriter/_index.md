## TeXStreamWriter class

Provides writing to a text stream.



The TeXStreamWriter type exposes the following members:
## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `encoding` | Returns the character encoding in which the output is written. |
| `new_line` | Gets or sets the line terminator string used by the current TextWriter. |
## Methods
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `write_line()` | Writes a line terminator to the text stream. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of a Boolean value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes a string to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes a character to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(buffer)` | Writes an array of characters to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of a decimal value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 8-byte floating-point value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte floating-point value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte signed integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte signed integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte unsigned integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write_line(value)` | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte unsigned integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of a Boolean value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes a character to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes a string to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes an array of characters to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of a decimal value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 8-byte floating-point value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte floating-point value to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte signed integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte signed integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of a 4-byte unsigned integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `write(value)` | Writes the text representation of an 8-byte unsigned integer to the text stream, followed by a line terminator. |
| `flush()` | Clears all buffers for the current writer and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device. |
| `close()` | Closes the current writer and releases any system resources associated with the writer. |
