## PdfEncryptionAlgorithm enumeration

Encryption mode enum. Describe using algorithm and key length.
This enum is extended in order to be able to further increase functionality.
This enum implements "Base-to-Core" pattern.



The PdfEncryptionAlgorithm type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| RC4_40 | Algorithm, with an RC4 encryption key length of 40 bits; |
| RC4_128 | Algorithm, with an RC4 encryption key length of 128 bits and advanced permission set; |
